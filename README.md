#### Abstract
Low-light images often suffer from severe visual degradation, impacting human percep-
tion and high-level computer vision tasks. Most existing methods process images in the
spatial domain, making it challenging to simultaneously improve brightness while sup-
pressing noise. In this paper, we present a novel perspective to enhance images based
on frequency domain characteristics. Specifically, we reveal that the low-frequency
components are closely related to luminance and color, whereas the high-frequency
components are not. Based on this observation, we propose the Frequency-aware Net-
work (FaNet) for low-light image enhancement. By selectively adjusting low-frequency
components, the brightness of the image is improved, while high-frequency details are
preserved. Additionally, we employ multi-scale framework and selective fusion to ef-
fectively obtain contextual information. Experimental results demonstrate the superior-
ity and the effectiveness of the proposed method
